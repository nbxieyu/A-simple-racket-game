# A-simple-racket-game


This is a project from 2016 Winter seesion CSC104 Universitt of Toronro
The original project is a simple game that random rock and tree on the map, and playe can move on grass.

I make some changes, so that two  users can play together to grab the diamond which is randomly created on the map. The psotion of 
the diamond will change, the first one who touch the diamond will win the game.
